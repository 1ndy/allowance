 Earn virtual rewards for real life financial accomplishments
<p>There’s no ignoring the fact that finance can be...a little boring. For those just starting a career especially, the idea of creating a long term financial plan is daunting, and saving money for emergencies feels like a waste. These important steps to becoming financially empowered are ignored and consequences for individuals and society can be severe. Allowance makes financial empowerment simple and fun by offering virtual rewards for real life achievements. By choosing a financial goal like buying a house or starting a family, users can see professionally recommended preparedness steps* to help them attain that goal. The app automatically tracks the user’s wealth and credit score, meaning the only thing they have to do to become financially empowered is play. Users can also choose to share their progress, making a once boring activity into a fun competition. Allowance lets the user plan financial decisions, save towards their goals, and win at financial empowerment.</p>


## Inspiration
Finances are hard. As kids, money seems so powerful. You get  a crisp $20 bill and you feel like you're on the top of the world. Why does that feeling vanish. What can be accomplished to make finances feel less like a burden and more like a competition. We set out to solve this. We wanted it to be more than just budgeting. But empowering you to take control of your money and accomplish those goals. 

## What it does
Allowance lets the user plan financial decisions, save towards their goals, and win at financial empowerment. It automatically tracks the player’s wealth and credit score, meaning the only thing they have to do to become financially empowered is play. To play, players choose a financial goal like buying a house or starting a family, and can see professionally recommended preparedness steps to help them attain that goal. Players compete against each other, turning a boring task into a fun competition.

## How I built it
Because allowance is meant to feel like a game, (and for the sake of time) we chose unity as our primary technology. This allowed us to avoid tons of boilerplate code and instead focus on implementing our idea. It also doesn’t constrain us to a particular platform. 

## Challenges I ran into
Unity is tough to work with for source control managers. So working on the project with teammates was a challenge doing it remotely. We solved this by minimizing the amount of changes done that could conflict during each push. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Our team is proud of the application. We took an idea, and turned it into a fully functional proof of concept. The prototype we built does not have everything that we envisioned, simply due to the time restrictions. But we are proud of the working application that shows the workflow.

## What I learned
We learned that Unity is overkill for this application. If we could do it again we definitely would use Unity however. Unity is so powerful because you don't need tons of code to make simple things work and look good. Because of time constrictions this was a huge factor in our decision. 

## What's next for Allowance 
Being a startup, we would love to see this app go somewhere. Security is always a risk when considering bank account information, so the first thing would be to create a secure application that can utilize bank APIs.
